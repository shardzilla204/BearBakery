Multiplayer Notes:
- Use RpcId() when you want to communicate with a specific client
- Use CallLocal when you want the caller to also use the method
- Don't use Rpc when CallLocal is true as it will create an infinite loop

Two methods to communicate with server to clients:
1. Call the method, but use Rpc to call the clients. Make sure it's nested in an if statement for Multiplayer.IsServer() as the condition (Only for server -> client communication)
2. Call the rpc, but have CallLocal = true, so that the caller will also use the method (More flexible as any client can use it)
